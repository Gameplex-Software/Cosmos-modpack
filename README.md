<h2>STORY</h2>
<p>Plants, trees, water, life. The earth was once a beautiful world every inch of it covered in and pulsing with life, and of course the ruled of it all, earth&rsquo;s greatest being. Man. Until man turned on nature to greed, to government, to money, and to war. By the 24th century all but a handful of the nations of the world remained, all massive superpowers fighting over small scraps of land in between them. It ended with a bomb, A species that had been observing earth had decided that Earth posed too much of a risk to the rest of the beings in the universe, they were a pragmatic species, accustomed to making the most logical decision no matter the cost. They released their bomb and eliminated the threat.</p>

<p>Some Human vessels were crewed during the attack and witnessed it happen, these lived on for many months but supplies on many had dwindled. After a short time pirate vessels began prowling for abandoned ships or husks of dead space stations, however not turning up much one crew decided to go a step further. They selected a lightly armed station and staged an attack, almost immediately they had disabled the stations shields and damaged a section of it. The crew boarded and looted the cargo bays, stripping them to the bulkheads, and of the crew of 20 7 were known to be killed the others vanished with the pirates.</p>
<p>You wake up and gasp, you feel a startling pain in your ribs and groan as you stand. &ldquo;Wher&ndash;?&rdquo; you start to ask as you try to remember. &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; you cannot remember. &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; you slowly realize you cant remember anything, not one fact about you, not your name, not a friend&rsquo;s name. Nothing. You listen for sounds, people sounds, but hear none. &ldquo;HELLOOOOOO?!&rdquo; you call out, and hearing nothing but your own voice in distant reply, you continue to look around the room.</p>
<p>You hear an alert sounding and look around, you are on a station in a hub by the airlock. The computer terminal nearby has a list of damaged areas and maintenance tasks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to do these first&rdquo; you almost whisper to yourself &ldquo;before anything else&rdquo;.</p>
